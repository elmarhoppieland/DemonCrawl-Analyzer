# DemonCrawl History And Statistics
 A program that analyses DemonCrawl log files. It gives an overview of all quests you created, and can also show what percentage of runs made it to a victory.
## Can it see everything?
 No, the program can only see log files for a limited number of sessions. By default this number is 100 sessions. It does, however store previously analysed log files so when you start a new session the data does not get lost.
 The program also can't see everything that's going on in the game. Only specific events that the game specifically logs can be tracked. All toast messages are always logged, so, in theory, it is possible to track everything shown in one of those messages.
