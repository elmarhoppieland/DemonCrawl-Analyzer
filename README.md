# DemonCrawl History And Statistics
 A program that analyses DemonCrawl log files. It gives an overview of all quests you created,
 and can also show what percentage of runs made it to a victory.

## How to use
### Download
 To download the program, head over to the releases tab on the right and download the
 .zip file. Extract it to your computer, and then run the .exe file.
### Usage
 Once you have downloaded the program, you can run it by simply running the .exe
 file. Click "Initialize Analyzer" and it will read through your DemonCrawl logs folder
 and show relevant information, divided into different tabs. *Note:* Since reading all of
 DemonCrawl's log files take some time, the Analyzer most likely will freeze for a moment
 after clicking on "Initalize Analyzer". Just give the Analyzer a few seconds to load, and
 everything will be fine.

## Features
### History
 This tab shows an overview of all quests you created in the last 100 sessions.
 In every quest, it shows a list of stages you entered, and it shows your inventory
 whenever you entered or leaved a stage. It also shows your stats at the start of
 every stage.
### Wins
 This tab shows the amount of times you won or lost. It is divided per mastery and
 per profile, and a Global tab that shows all your quests, regardless of profile.
### Statistics
 This tab shows some statistics for all quests created in the last 100 sessions,
 split per profile. It shows the number of chests you opened, the number of artifacts
 collected, the number of items gained, the amount of lives restored and the amount
 of coins spent. Do note that it does not include anything done while in Arena.
### Filtering
 In the top-right corner, there is a button to filter quests based on when they
 were created or what kind of quest it is. You can specify a timeframe in which
 the quests were created, and/or specify the types of quests that are shown.
 Changing filters affects all tabs.

## Additional notes
- The Analyzer cannot see all quests you created. It can only go back as far as
  the earliest log file. By default, this means it can go back 100 sessions. There
  is a DemonCrawl setting to change this number, but increasing it will increase
  load times and disk space.
