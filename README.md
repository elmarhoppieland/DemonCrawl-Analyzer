# DemonCrawl History And Statistics
 A program that analyses DemonCrawl log files. It gives an overview of all quests you created,
 and can also show what percentage of runs made it to a victory.
## How to use
### Download
 To download the program, head over to the releases tab on the right and download the
 .exe and .pck files.
### Usage
 Once you have downloaded the program, you can run it by simply double-clicking
 the .exe file. It will automatically read through your DemonCrawl logs folder
 and show relevant information, divided into different tabs.
## History
 This tab shows an overview of all quests you created in the last 100 sessions.
 In every quest, it shows a list of stages you entered, and it shows your inventory
 whenever you entered or leaved a stage. It also shows your stats at the start of
 every stage.
## Wins
 This tab shows the amount of times you won or lost. It is divided per mastery and
 per profile, and a Global tab that shows all your quests, regardless of profile.
## Can it see everything?
 No, the program can only see log files for a limited number of sessions. By default,
 this number is 100 sessions. It does, however store previously analysed log files so when
 you start a new session the data does not get lost. The program also can't see everything
 that's going on in the game. Only specific events that the game specifically logs can be
 tracked. All toast messages are always logged, so, in theory, it is possible to track
 everything shown in one of those messages.
